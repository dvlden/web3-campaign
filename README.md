# Campaign

A project built with **Solidity** + **Vue 3**.

**REPLACE THIS WITH AN ACTUAL SCREENSHOT** _(on project completion)_

Each directory has its own corresponding README file, to get you started. But if you just want to run the project, you may do so:

- `cd client && npm i && npm run dev`

> **IMPORTANT:** If you want to stick with Rinkeby Testnet, I suggest requesting Ether from [Chainlink](https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby).

This is my second **web3 project**. If you want to follow my journey, make sure to follow me on:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/dvlden/)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dvlden)

Much appreciated :heart: !

> **NOTE:** I may or may not come back to this web3 projects in the future, to improve it with design and/or new features.
